In this project, a lot of conditionals are implemented. The input is processed multiple times before any math operation is executed. The output also needs to be processed to avoid trailing decimal zeros, many digits exceeding display, exponential notation and must display an error when dividing by zero. The page is also responsive for different resolutions.
